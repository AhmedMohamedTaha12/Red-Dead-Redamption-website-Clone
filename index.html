                    <h1>Red Dead Redamption 2</h1>
                    <p>
                        Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. 
                        The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. 
                        The story is set in a fictionalized representation of the United States in 1899 and follows the exploits of Arthur Morgan, an outlaw and member of the Van der Linde gang, who must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries.
                         The game is presented through first- and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive open world. 
                         Gameplay elements include shootouts, robberies, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. 
                        A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player.

                                This is a story – a collection of stories, really – about the decline of a way of life, as a small gang of outlaws tries ever harder to outrun the inexorable advance of American modernity, as well as the enemies and lawmen they have antagonised along the way...There can be no doubt that this is a landmark game. It is a new high water-mark for lifelike video game worlds..."

                            <p>It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can’t wait to go back and play more. This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era.

                            <p>Rockstar is the master of open-world building, of course, with nothing coming close to Grand Theft Auto V’s urban sprawl until now. Red Dead Redemption 2 feels more of an artistic challenge. You will not find a better facsimile of Los Angeles than GTAV’s Los Santos, but in a sense that world is already defined by artifice. Creating something as natural as Red Dead Redemption 2 is a seismic achievement</p>

                            <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has undoubtedly raised the bar for narrative open-world games and will likely have a lasting impact on how they are made in the future. It pushes the envelope of what we understand is possible in a video game. It seems that every time we get something new from Rockstar, things inevitably change.</p>
